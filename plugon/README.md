Development for creating a website for sharing PocketMine-MP plugins.

Designed to replace the 'Plugins' page at [Pocketmine](https://pocketmine.net)

# Why Plug-On Was Created

Plug-On was created to combat the lack of plugins availiable on the Pocketmine Plugins page. Plugin reviewers became inactive so authors were unable to post their work for server owners to use. Plug-On aims to stop this lack of Plugins available to server owners and bring a new flow of creativity into the Pocketmine Community. 

# What it is

Plug-On is a dynamic plugin list for Pocketmine-MP. It has a login system, as well as a user voting system. Users vote for plugins they like, and they work their way to the top. Admins do not have to approve plugins (But that feature can be implemented if it's to your liking), but Admins can see every plugin that gets posted, and if the comments or content on the plugin are bad, then they can remove the plugins and take action against the author if needed. 

This project is still being developed, you can check our progress on the [projects](https://github.com/PMPluginDevelopers/Plug-On/projects/1) section to stay updated as we approach the first release. 

# How You Can Help!

Want to help make Plug-On better for all? We are looking for developers well versed in PHP or HTML (or both!) to help develop our website software. 

Not a Programmer? You can help as well! By Downloading this repository, extracting it into a folder, and opening up the index.html file, you can help us bug test! Please don't post duplicate Issues.
