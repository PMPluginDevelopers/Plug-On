Development for creating a website for sharing PocketMine-MP plugins.

Designed to replace the 'Plugins' page at https://pocketmine.net

# General Information
Plug-On is a project meant to give Pocketmine-MP Plugin developers a chance to publish their plugins. It replaces the 'Plugins' page, as mentioned above. It was created because of the inability of Developers to submit their plugins to Pocketmine.
